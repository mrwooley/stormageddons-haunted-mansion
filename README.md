## Introduction
Welcome to Stormageddon's Haunted Mansion, a spine-tingling text-based adventure game I created for fun after completing Computer Architecture and Assembly at OSU. Based 
loosely on my spinach loving, oddball cat Stormageddon, this game, written entirely in MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler), invites players to explore a mysterious, eerie 
mansion filled with secrets and dangers. OOoooOOoooOo!

## Game Overview
In Stormageddon's Haunted Mansion, you find yourself standing before an ominous house following the receipt of an enigmatic letter. The letter beckons you to meet an 
unknown individual at this location. Your task is to probe the depths of the abandoned mansion, seeking clues and unraveling the mysteries that shroud this spooky dwelling.

## How to Play
Navigate the game by selecting from a set of options when prompted. Be cautious with your choices as some actions can prove fatal! If you do encounter a fatal action, you 
have the option to retry from the previous set of options. Occassionally, you may need to fill out inputs for various puzzles.

You can play using the executable in the Release.zip folder.
